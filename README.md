In order to be fully prepared for the first day of Advent, you can use this small template to aid you in setting the file structure, scraping the puzzle data & running testing solutions for each day.
Inspired by [AoC Rust starter template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust) developed by [fspoettel](https://github.com/fspoettel).

Three options are available:

```ruby
  rake setup # scaffold the file structure & scrape your day

  rake test # test a single day (e.g. rake 'test[10]') or the whole suite

  rake run # run a solution for a single day (e.g. rake 'run[12]')

```

**Setup command**

Running setup will open a prompt

```ruby
  def display_menu
    choices = [
      { name: '🌟 Scaffold files for a delightful advent day 🌟', value: 'scaffold' },
      { name: '🎁 Scrape the festive data for an advent day 🎁', value: 'scrape' },
    ]

    prompt.select("", choices)
  end
```

where you can choose to either scaffold the files or scrape the data (or both).

**Scaffold** files command will generate the following file structure within your directory with some minimal boilerplate code to help you start writing the code immediately.

```js
     src
     ├── day1.rb
     ├── day2.rb
     ├── ...


    spec
     ├── day1_spec.rb
     ├── day2_spec.rb
     ├── ...
```


**Scrape** data command will scrape the data for the day you provided via the CLI. Data is stored within a .txt file in the *data* directory.
Part 2 will only be scrapped if you have completed part 1 for that day

```js
     data
     ├── day1_part1.txt
     ├── day2_part2.txt
     ├── ...
```

<span class="text-red-600">**Important!**</span>
<br> To be able to scrape the data, you need to provide a cookie. Cookie can be restored from developers tools in the network tab.

Create a .env file in the rooot directory.
Provide your cookie in ```.env``` file.

```ruby
  AOC_COOKIE="your_cookie_goes_here"
```
